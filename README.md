Somewhere in this world, there is a server automating HTTP authenication,
for all Chinese university physics course login. Here is the source code.
Written in Sinatra, Ruby

Note
========
Note that the source code is highly "unoptimised", because I wrote it in 2 days,
and performance is not a main issue.  In addition, yaml config verification
from admin frontend is minimal.  But I believe it is quite secure from attack.
